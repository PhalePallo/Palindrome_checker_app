# 🧠 Palindrome Checker App

A simple web application that checks if a given word, phrase, or sentence is a **palindrome** — a sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spaces.

> Built to fulfill FreeCodeCamp’s Frontend Project challenge, and expanded for practical learning and enhancement.

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. The user enters a word, phrase, or sentence into the input box.
2. Upon clicking the **Check** button:
   - The app removes all non-alphanumeric characters.
   - Converts everything to lowercase.
   - Compares the cleaned string to its reverse.
3. Displays whether the input **is** or **is not** a palindrome in the result area.
4. Includes a **dark mode** toggle and accessibility features.

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3** – Responsive design, dark mode, and visual enhancements
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation and core palindrome logic
- **Live Server** – For live preview during development
